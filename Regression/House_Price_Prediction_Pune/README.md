# Pune House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices in the Pune area using a machine learning model. It leverages historical housing data to provide accurate price predictions based on key features such as area, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and more. Data visualization techniques are used for insights, and a Streamlit application has been developed to enhance user experience.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts house prices based on input parameters.
- **Data Visualization**: Helps analyze trends and key factors influencing prices.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input details and receive price predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Streamlit** (for the interactive web app)
- **Scikit-learn** (for model training and evaluation)

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaitanya-03c/Machine-Learning/Regression/House_Price_Prediction_Pune.git
   cd pune-house-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. Users input details such as location, square footage, BHK, and other relevant parameters.
2. The model processes the input and predicts the expected house price.
3. Visualization tools display insights into price trends and influencing factors.
4. The Streamlit app offers an easy-to-use interface for price prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical Pune housing data with features like location, size, price, and more.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms.
- Include more parameters like nearby amenities and connectivity.
- Add real-time housing market trends.
