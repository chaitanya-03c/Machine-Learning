# IPL Score Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict IPL scores using a machine learning regression model. It leverages historical match data and key features to make accurate score predictions. Additionally, data visualization is used for better insights, and a Streamlit application has been developed to provide an interactive user experience.

## Features
- **Regression Model**: Used for predicting IPL scores based on past match data.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insights into factors affecting match scores.
- **Streamlit App**: Interactive web application for users to input match details and get predictions in real time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning (Regression Model)**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Streamlit** (for the interactive web app)
- **Scikit-learn** (for model training and evaluation)

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaitanya-03c/Machine-Learning/Regression/IPL-Dataset.git
  
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. Users input match details such as teams, venue, overs played, and wickets lost.
2. The model processes the input data and predicts the final IPL score.
3. Visualization tools display key factors influencing the score.
4. The Streamlit app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the model.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of past IPL matches with relevant features like team performance, venue, and match conditions.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms.
- Incorporate real-time match data.
- Add more visualization and analytical features.
